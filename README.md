Rainb0t is my personal bot that I use on my Discord servers.
This bot is based on the template provided at [kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template)

## Installation

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for managing packages and an isolated environment. Make sure you have an official build of Python and have installed Poetry before attempting to install Rainb0t.

1. Use the [git](https://git-scm.com/) command to install Rainb0t: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rainb0wCodes/Rainb0t.git
```

2. Use the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager to install all dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

Input your bot token and related configuration into `config.py`. If you are uploading your bot source to a GitHub repo, see the answers to [this StackOverflow questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9794931/keep-file-in-a-git-repo-but-dont-track-changes) on how to keep your token safe.  
Run Rainb0t with the command: `poetry run python bot.py`
